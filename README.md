# 📈 Understanding Linear Regression: An Ages and Heights Case Study

Welcome to this beginner-friendly machine learning project! This repository walks you through **Simple Linear Regression** using a real-world-inspired dataset of **Ages** and **Heights**.

---

## 🧠 Project Goal

Learn how to build, interpret, and evaluate a linear regression model that predicts a person’s **Height** based on their **Age**.

---

## 📊 What is Linear Regression?

Linear Regression fits a straight line through a scatter of points to predict a **numerical target** (like height) based on an **input feature** (like age).

**Formula:**

```
ŷ = β₀ + β₁x
```

Where:

* ŷ is the predicted target (Height)
* β₀ is the intercept
* β₁ is the slope (coefficient)
* x is the input feature (Age)

---

## 📁 Dataset

This dataset contains:

* `Age` (feature)
* `Height` (target)

It’s ideal for demonstrating core regression concepts without distractions.

---

## 📌 Project Workflow

### 1. 🧹 Data Loading & Exploration

* Load and preview the dataset
* Visualize data with a scatter plot
* Check for realistic values (e.g., `Age > 0`)

### 2. 🛠 Data Preparation

* Define `X` (features) and `y` (target)
* Train/test split to evaluate generalization

### 3. 📈 Model Training

* Use `scikit-learn`’s `LinearRegression`
* Fit the model on training data

### 4. 📐 Model Interpretation

* Get and explain:

  * **Intercept** (`model.intercept_`)
  * **Slope** (`model.coef_`)
* Understand what the model is *really* saying

### 5. 🔍 Prediction & Visualization

* Predict heights on test data
* Plot the regression line over actual points

### 6. 📏 Model Evaluation

* Calculate **R² Score**
* Interpret model’s ability to explain variance in height

### 7. ✅ Assumption Checks

* **Residuals vs Feature plot** (linearity & homoscedasticity)
* **Histogram** of residuals (normality)
* **Q-Q Plot** (formal normality check)

## ▶️ How to Run

### 1. Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abdulganiu99/Understanding-Linear-Models
cd https://github.com/abdulganiu99/Understanding-Linear-Models
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn scipy
```

### 3. Set Up the Dataset

Place `AgesAndHeights.pkl` at:

```
data/AgesAndHeights.pkl
```

(Modify this path in the code if yours is different.)

### 4. Run the Script

```bash
python Understanding_Linear_Regression.ipynb
```

The script outputs results in your console and saves plots as `.png` files.

## 🧼 Optional: Clean Jupyter Notebooks Before Commit

If using Jupyter:

```bash
pip install nbstripout
nbstripout --install
```

To clean existing notebooks (Windows):

```bash
for /r . %i in (*.ipynb) do nbstripout --force "%i"
```

(Linux/macOS):

```bash
find . -name '*.ipynb' -exec nbstripout --force {} \;
```

## 🎓 Learn by Doing

This hands-on project helps you internalize:

* Linear regression mechanics
* Interpretation of model coefficients
* Evaluating regression models
* Assumption checking (a step many ignore)
